00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.075
In this video, we will present basic attributes and methods of DataFrame,

2
00:00:11.075 --> 00:00:14.310
which we will use a lot in this course.

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.005
Then we will discuss one of the most important skills for beginners,

4
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:22.160
how to select some portion of data.

5
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.540
To begin with, let's first take a look at what DataFrame looks like.

6
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.050
We can print serveral rows at the top DataFrame,

7
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.535
fb which is historical data for Facebook.

8
00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:39.030
The method we used is head.

9
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.135
It gives us the first five rows of the DataFrame.

10
00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:44.700
As you can see,

11
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.610
Pandas DataFrame is a tabular structure of data.

12
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.195
It has rows and columns.

13
00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:53.145
There is an index,

14
00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:55.990
which gives a base for each row.

15
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.760
There are columns of open,

16
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.840
high, low, adjust close, and volume.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.260
Open and close are the opening price and the closing price.

18
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.270
High and low are the highest in price and the lowest price.

19
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.685
Adjust close is a stock closing price,

20
00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:20.655
on a given day of trading that has been amended to include

21
00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:28.130
any dispution and the corporate actions occurred at anytime before the next day's open.

22
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.985
Every data type in Python had its own methods and attributes.

23
00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:37.505
As the example of attributes,

24
00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:40.545
we can check index like this.

25
00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:45.665
They also can get the first index and the last index,

26
00:01:45.665 --> 00:01:48.890
so that we can extract information

27
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.015
about the starting date and the final date of this data.

28
00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:57.865
We can also can get columns by typing fb columns.

29
00:01:57.865 --> 00:02:02.110
Another important attribute of a DataFrame is the size.

30
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.075
The size of DataFrame can be described by the number of rows and columns.

31
00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:11.425
We use shape to get a size.

32
00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:17.880
In this course, number rows stands for the number of observations,

33
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.970
and the column number represents how many variables in the data.

34
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.730
As methods, head and tail are often used to check whether

35
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.795
data is correct or to check contents of index and columns.

36
00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:44.545
With tail, you can get the last five rows.

37
00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:48.530
In fact, you can specify how many rows

38
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.590
you want by putting number of rows inside the parentheses.

39
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.605
There is another method called describe,

40
00:02:57.605 --> 00:03:01.485
which can give you some summary statistics for each column.

41
00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:07.220
For example, in this output which is also the format of DataFrame,

42
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.330
the first column lists number mean standard deviation etc., for open price.

43
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.500
Next, we will discuss selection of data from DataFrame.

44
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.390
Sometimes you only need a subset data.

45
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.565
For example, select only close price of 2015. How to do that.

46
00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:38.725
There are two ways to slice a DataFrame,

47
00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:43.370
selection by label and selection by position.

48
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.325
For example, if you want the close price on the first day of 2015,

49
00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:56.265
you can use a method loc along with labels of index and the column.

50
00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:59.665
The first entry is the index label.

51
00:03:59.665 --> 00:04:03.930
The second entry of label is a column name.

52
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.215
Alternatively, you also can select by position using iloc.

53
00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:15.520
The first entry stands for row number.

54
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.130
The second is a column number.

55
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.740
The position starts with zero.

56
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.755
You can select multiple rows.

57
00:04:26.755 --> 00:04:33.345
For example, we can get close price for the whole year of 2015.

58
00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:37.635
This selects close price from 2015,

59
00:04:37.635 --> 00:04:42.685
January 1 to 2015, December 31.

60
00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:46.985
We also can select multiple columns.

61
00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:53.070
The colon sign in the second entry of iloc means all columns.

62
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.915
DataFrame has built in method of plot,

63
00:04:58.915 --> 00:05:05.060
which means you can plot data directly without importing matplotlib.

64
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.350
There is a method called plot in pandas DataFrame.

65
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.815
You can easily visualize the close price with this method.

66
00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:20.090
You even can slice close price into different years,

67
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.280
and visualize them one by one.

68
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.310
In this video, you have learned attributes methods of DataFrame.

69
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.525
Please, get familiar with this part,

70
00:05:34.525 --> 00:05:37.880
and do some practice in Jupyter Notebook.

71
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.700
We will use these skills a lot in our formal analysis of financial data.
